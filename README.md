Task Description: Article Summarization Tool
Objective:
Develop a Python-based tool that automatically summarizes long articles or documents using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

Problem Statement:
Reading and processing lengthy articles can be time-consuming. There's a need for an automated solution that can extract and present the most important information from a large body of text in a concise form.

Approach:
Utilize pre-trained transformer-based models (e.g., BART or T5) from Hugging Faceâ€™s transformers library to perform abstractive summarization. The tool takes an input article, processes it through the summarization model, and returns a concise summary that preserves the core meaning and key insights.

Deliverable:
A standalone Python script that:

Accepts long-form input text.

Generates a short, coherent summary.

Can be run locally or adapted into a web app or API.
